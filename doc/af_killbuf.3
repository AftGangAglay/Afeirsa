.SH NAME
\fBaf_killbuf\fP \- destroy graphics buffer

.SH SYNOPSIS
enum af_err \fBaf_killbuf\fP(
struct af_ctx* \fIctx\fP,
struct af_buf* \fIbuf\fP
)

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaf_killbuf\fP destroys the graphics buffer object in the storage pointed to
by \fIbuf\fP which was previously passed to \fBaf_mkbuf\fP(3).
Any operations involving the buffer (including drawlist operations the buffer
may have been included in) are undefined after this point.

Reinitializing a new graphics buffer in the same storage is not guaranteed to
resolve any dangling references to a destroyed buffer. Given no dangling
references are outstanding, the storage pointed to by \fIbuf\fP is safe to use
for new buffers.
