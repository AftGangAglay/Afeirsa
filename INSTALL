			Building

To build, run `make'. With the following variables set appropriately.

         APPLE  Must be defined when building on macOS
        GLXABI  Use `<GL/*>' for GL includes. Switches macOS to use XQuartz
     NO_STDLIB	Disables use of the standard library
   GL10_COMPAT	Restricts core feature usage to OpenGL 1.0
        NO_EXT	Disables use of OpenGL extensions
         DEBUG	Perform a debug build with symbols and no optimizations
BUILD_EXAMPLES	Build example programs alongside the library
         STDCC  Only use `cc' opts complying with X/Open LEGACY XCU `cc'
     WANT_GLUT  Provide an appropriate GLUT environment for the GL ABI

			Installing

To install, run `make install' with the same options as used for building.
The install prefix can be configured with the `PREFIX' variable (Default is
`/usr/local'). Root privileges may be required depending on the install
