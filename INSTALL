			Building

To build, run `make'. Optionally with the following variables set:

     NO_STDLIB	Disables use of the standard library
   GL10_COMPAT	Restricts core feature usage to OpenGL 1.0
        NO_EXT	Disables use of OpenGL extensions
         DEBUG	Perform a debug build with symbols and no optimizations
BUILD_EXAMPLES	Build example programs alongside the library

			Installing

To install, run `make install' with the same options as used for building.
The install prefix can be configured with the `PREFIX' variable (Default is
`/usr/local'). Root privileges may be required depending on the install
location.
