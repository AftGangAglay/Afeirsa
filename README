			Afeirsa

A super basic GL abstraction for use in Malei and some other bits and bobs.

Afeirsa aims to provide a light abstraction over OpenGL to improve convenience
of use in applications. It is not a renderer nor does it handle context
creation or management.

The primary manner in which it simplifies development is that, where possible,
missing features for a particular feature level are implemented in software
within Afeirsa. This does come with the downside of handles and the like
carrying more heft for contextual information to avoid large internal
bookkeeping operations.
