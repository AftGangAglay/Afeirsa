			Afeirsa

Fixed and Programmable Pipeline OpenGL Graphics Layer.

Afeirsa aims to provide a light abstraction over OpenGL to improve convenience
of use in graphical applications.
It is not a renderer nor does it handle context creation or management.

See the file `LICENCE' for licence information.
See the file `INSTALL' for build and install information.
See the file `VERSION' for the current library version.

The base library build process only requires that `GL/gl.h' and other headers
specified here: https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/ABI/ are available.
Platforms which require an explicit exception to this, have such (using
`OpenGL/gl.h' etc. on macOS for example).
